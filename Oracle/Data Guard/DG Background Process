Oracle Data Guard Background Processes
======================================

--Note:-<IMP>
select process, status, sequence# from v$managed_standby;
Type of the PROCESS whose information is being reported:
	PROCESS    | ROLE                       | DESCRIPTION
	-----------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------
	RFS        | Remote File Server         | Receives redo log files from the primary database.
	MRP        | Managed Recovery Process   | Applies redo data to the standby database.
	LNS        | Log Network Server         | Transmits redo data to standby databases.
	ARCn       | Archiver                   | Archives redo log files received from the primary.
	NSV        | Network Server             | Handles network services for redo shipping.
	DGRD       | Data Guard Broker Process  | Monitors and manages Data Guard if enabled.

	
Current process STATUS:
	ALLOCATED 		- Process is active but not currently connected to a primary database
	ANNOUNCING 		- Process is announcing the existence of a potential dependent archived redo log
	APPLYING_LOG 	- Process is actively applying the archived redo log to the standby database
	ATTACHED 		- Process is actively attached and communicating to a primary database
	CLOSING 		- Process has completed archival and is closing the archived redo log
	CONNECTED 		- Network connection established to a primary database
	ERROR 			- Process has failed
	IDLE 			- Process is not performing any activities
	OPENING 		- Process is opening the archived redo log
	RECEIVING 		- Process is receiving network communication
	REGISTERING 	- Process is registering the existence of a completed dependent archived redo log
	UNUSED 			- No active process
	WAIT_FOR_GAP 	- Process is waiting for the archive gap to be resolved
	WAIT_FOR_LOG 	- Process is waiting for the archived redo log to be completed
	WRITING 		- Process is actively writing redo data to the archived redo log


LSP [Logical Standby ]:
		It comes into play for logical dataguard only. 
		It controls the application of archived redo log information to the logical standby database. 
		LSP process will transform redo data into sql statements and then these sql statements will be applied to logical standby database.
		


## Data Guard Archive Process
	We have seen 4 numbers ARCH processes when you query v$managed_standby. 
	That’s alright, because of 4 is the default value of LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES.

	The LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES initialization parameter specifies the number of ARCn processes that the database initially starts. 
	The default is 4 processes. There is usually no need specify this initialization parameter or to change its default value, 
	because the database starts additional archiver processes (ARCn) as needed to ensure that the automatic processing of filled redo log files does not fall behind.

	However, to avoid any run-time overhead of starting additional ARCn processes, 
	you can set the LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES initialization parameter to specify that up to 30 ARCn processes be started at instance startup. 
	The LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES parameter is dynamic, so you can change it using the ALTER SYSTEM statement.

	In most cases the default for LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES is sufficient. 
	However, in a Data Guard configurations that have multiple standby databases it may be necessary to increase the number of archive processes. 
	The value of the LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES initialization parameter must be at least one greater than the total number of all remote destinations. 
	Use the following equation when setting the LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES parameter for highly available environments

		LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES = sum(remote_destinations) + count(threads)
		
		Source: Set the LOG_ARCHIVE_MAX_PROCESSES Parameter


## Data Guard RFS Processes
	3 Numbers of RFS processes

	RFS processes are spawned regarding the amount of remote archiver connections (due to ARC in your DG configuration). 
	One ARC process is related to local archiving on primary database and so 3 are left for DG transmission, this can be parallelised as well, 
	but needs additional parameter setting MAX_CONNECTIONS.



## Data Guard MRP Process
	1 number of MRP0process

	How many Managed Standby Recovery Processes do you expect? 
	It is the coordinator – and like in real life only one guy is the boss

	The ARCH redo transport mode has been deprecated and will be de-supported in a future release. 
	Oracle recommends that you switch to the ASYNC transport mode if you are currently using the ARCH transport mode. 
	The ASYNC transport mode is superior to the ARCH transport mode in all respects, and is the new default transport mode.
