Tablespace Point-in-time Recovery
=================================

Why Tablespace PITR Recovery?
-->
Let us assume that you have a problem only with one user and the transaction that the user executed has impacted one table that reside under one tablespace or one data file. 
So rather than performing the entire database point in time recovery, We can perform single tablespace point in time recovery just before the transactions were issued. 
In this way, only the affected tablespace will not be available for the users. Rest all database will still be up and running.


How it works?

TBPITR is different from DBPITR
-->
In DBPITR, the entire database is restored to back in time. 
In TBPITR, we take the tablespace back in time or before the wrong transactions are issued.


It’s not straight restore and recover
-->
Once tablespace is dropped, you cannot restore at via RMAN as details of the tablespace are removed from the control file.


:: Let us say somebody dropped the entire tablespace and then you try to issue the command restore tablespace from RMAN. 
   The command will not work because once you drop the tablespace, control files will update that this tablespace does not exist. 
   This means even if you try to restore it from RMAN, the tablespace will not be restored.

+-------------------------+
+ TSPITR Recovery Methods +
+-------------------------+
-->
There are three methods which you can use to recover dropped tablespace:

1.Create DB clone with PITR before tablespace drop, export tablespace from clone DB and import into original database
2.Perform entire database Point In Time recovery. This lead to downtime + loss of data
3.Use automated RMAN TSPITR method

==>:3: RMAN TSPITR
-->
Its completely automated method.
You just have to run the command TBPITR and everything will be taken care.
To perform RMAN TSPITR, you need following

 - Timestamp or SCN when tablespace was dropped → You can get this information form alert log
 - A location with same space as your database size

On the same server you need another Mount point where a database of the same size will be cloned. 
Once you run the TSPITR, it will Create a clone of the database in the location that you specify and then it will export the tablespace, 
import it into original database and then clean the cloned instance. And all the steps are automatically done by RMAN.


** Note:- <IMP>
Make sure the location that you choose for the auxiliary instance of the cloned instance should have the same space or required space as an prod DB.

--| CREATE TEST TABLESPACE & USER FOR ACTIVITY
	create tablespace TBPITR datafile '/oracle/u02/DB/rcat/data/RCAT/tbpitr.dbf' size 10M;

	backup database format '/dbback/RCAT_DB_RMAN_Backups/RCAT_%U' plus archivelog format '/dbback/RCAT_DB_RMAN_Backups/RCAT_Archive_%U';


--| Check the database size and make sure you have a destination with same or more free space.

	col "Database Size" format a20

	select round(sum(used.bytes) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 ) || ' GB' "Database Size"

--| DROP THE TABLESPACE AND START TBPIT PROCESS

	drop tablespace TBPITR including contents and datafiles;


--| Let us try to restore the tablespace using RMAN

	RMAN> restore tablespace TBPITR; 		-- through error

--| Open the alert log and check the time when the tablespace was dropped. 

		2024-11-25T13:49:42.693380-05:00
		drop tablespace TBPITR including contents and datafiles

--| CONNECT TO RMAN AND START RECOVERY
	
run{
	recover tablespace TBPITR until time "to_date('25-nov-24 13:49:42','dd-mon-rr hh24:mi:ss')"
	auxiliary destination '/dbback/RCAT_auxiliary_loc';

--| Make TS online
	select status,tablespace_name from dba_tablespaces;
	alter tablespace TBPITR online;
