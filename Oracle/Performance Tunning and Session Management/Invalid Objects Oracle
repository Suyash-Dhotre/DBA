===============
Invalid Objects
===============

- Changing things in database can cause some objects to become INVALID. Query to check invalid objects in oracle

SELECT OWNER, OBJECT_TYPE, OBJECT_NAME 
FROM DBA_OBJECTS
WHERE STATUS != ‘VALID’ 
ORDER BY OWNER, OBJECT_TYPE;

OR

SELECT OWNER, STATUS FROM DBA_OBJECTS 
WEHRE STATUS !=’VALID’
GROUP BY OWNER, STATUS;


- Recompiling Invalid Objects
- You can handle INVALID objects to make them VALID. Execute the below script

ALTER PACKAGE package_name COMPILE;
ALTER PROCEDURE procedure_name COMPILE;
ALTER FUNCTION function_name COMPILE;
ALTER VIEW view_name COMPILE;

EXEC UTL_RECOMP.recomp_serial(‘schema name’);   --> Oracle 9i

EXEC DBMS_UTILITY.COMPILE_SCHEMA(‘SCOTT’);      --> 10g and above

SQL> @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql;

- Note: Oracle highly recommends running the script towards the end of any migration/upgrade/downgrade.
