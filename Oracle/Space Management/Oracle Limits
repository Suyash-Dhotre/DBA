Physical Oracle Database Limits
===============================

## DATABASE BLOCK SIZE
	min 2KB and max dependent on OS but never exceeds 32K

## DATABASE BLOCKS
	min in the initial extent of a segment = 2 blocks
	max per data file are platform dependent = 222 – 1 blocks

## DATABASE FILES
	max per tablespace = OS dependent, usually 1022
	max per database = 65533, sometimes less on different OS

## DATABASE FILE SIZE
	max size OS dependent. Limited by maximum operating system file size; 
	typically 222 or 4MB blocks. The max size of a single datafile is limited by the database block size. 
	Generally it’s 32TB for 8K block and 128TB for 32K block.

## TABLESPACES
	max no of tablespaces per database = 64K.
	Number of tablespaces cannot exceed the number of database files because each tablespace must include at least one file.

## CONTROLFILES
	min 1 controlfile required, recommended to have more than 1
	max size = 25000 X (db block size)

##REDOLOGFILES
	min size = 4MB
	max size = OS dependent, typically 2 GB
	max number of logfiles = limited by MAXLOGFILES parameter
	max number of logfiles per group = unlimited
